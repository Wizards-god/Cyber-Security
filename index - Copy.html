			Cybersecurity is the protection of internet-connected systems such as hardware, software and data from cyberthreats.<br> The practice is used by individuals and enterprises to protect against unauthorized access to data centers and other computerized systems. A strong cybersecurity strategy can provide a good security posture against malicious attacks designed to access, alter, delete, destroy or extort an organization's or user's systems and sensitive data.<br> Cybersecurity is also instrumental in preventing attacks that aim to disable or disrupt a system's or device's operations.

Good practices and tools such as anti-virus software, web-services, biometrics and secure personal devices, e.g., smart-card based USB token, the SIM card, the secure chip in payment card or an ePassport are digital security devices because they offer freedom to communicate, work, travel and shop using your digital identity in a way that is convenient, enjoyable and secure.
